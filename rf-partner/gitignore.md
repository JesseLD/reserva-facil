## ğŸ§  Notes

- Keep `storage/` in the project structure, but **ignore its dynamic contents**.
- Use `.gitkeep` to preserve folder structure when needed.
- Never commit `.env` files or secret keys.
- If you use SQLite, you may also want to add `database.sqlite` to `.gitignore`.

---

## ğŸ§¹ Optional extras

- If you use `phpunit`, add `tests/_output/`, `coverage/` to your ignore list.
- If you're compiling assets, ignore `/public/build/`, `/public/css/`, etc.

---

> Always test your `.gitignore` after modifying it:
> Use `git status` to ensure nothing sensitive or dynamic is being committed.
