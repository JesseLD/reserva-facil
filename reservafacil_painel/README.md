
# Flutter App Boilerplate

A simple and clean starting point for Flutter projects.

## How to Use

To recreate all boilerplate folders with a custom organization, run the following command:

```bash
flutter create --org com.your.organization .
```

**Additional Steps to Configure the App:**

1. **Rename the App**: Update the app name to reflect your project and ensure all imports are correct.
   - Change the name in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
   - Rename the main folder and update the project imports as needed.

2. **Project Structure**: Use the `lib/features/template` folder to expand your app following a simplified approach to Clean Architecture.

## State Management

This boilerplate is flexible and can be used with different state managers, such as:
- **Provider**
- **Bloc**
- Or any other of your choice
